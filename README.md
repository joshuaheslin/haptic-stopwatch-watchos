Haptic Fitness Timer is a simple app for Apple Watch, that uses haptic feedback to notify when your timer is up.



* Increase focus on your training *

The app is designed to improve your workout experience through increased focus by minimising interactions between you and your device. With haptic feedback you don't have to keep checking your stopwatch to see when your next set is up. This results in a less distracting workout experience.


* Use in the gym between sets *

Simply choose the duration of your timer. Once the timer is complete, the app uses haptic feedback to notify you that it is time to continue with your next set or exercise.


* Save time in the gym *

Complete your workouts more efficiently with Haptic Feedback Timer by reducing interactions with your devices. This app replaces the traditional timer or stopwatch.


* A less annoying timer *

A traditional timer continues to ring until the user presses the stop button. Haptic Feedback Timer stops automatically once the user has been notified. This reduces user interactions resulting in a more distraction-free workout experience.
